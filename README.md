ncursesw-win-rs
===============

This is a *thin* wrapper around the ncursesw-rs crate, it's purpose is too abstracts away the raw pointers that ncurses uses and functions in a more safe way, however a knowledge of how ncurses works is advised to use the true power of this library.

## Building

The compiled library will be built in the `target` directory.

```
cargo build
```
